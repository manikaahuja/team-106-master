# Team-106 : Seven-Qubits

> Problem Statement: St Jude India ChildCare Centres

We envision to build a comprehensive technological solution, which is intuitive and extremely easy to use and operate to solve the primary problem of ration distribution and allocation. 
Our comprehensive approach includes not just an elegant website functioning as an admin dashboard, but also a cross platform app working both on iOS and Android which would be used by the NGO personnel/volunteers on ground to vastly automate ration logging and distribution. 

## Distribution of Code

The entire codebase is split into various branches, each corresponding to a component of the full stack solution:
- frontend : contains the React codebase for the frontend of our website
- app-code : contains the Expo/React Native codebase for the cross platform app associated with our product
- backend : contains the backend Django/DRF codebase

## Hosted Links

We have conveniently hosted both the website!

The app, built in Expo (on top of React Native) is extremely easy to distribute as well, both for Android and iOS, without the need to put the apps on the respective platforms on either the Google Play Store or the Apple Store
